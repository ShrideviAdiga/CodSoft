            <p>Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was a key figure in introducing the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Born as Narendra Nath Datta, he was a prominent disciple of the 19th-century saint Ramakrishna. His teachings emphasized the importance of self-realization and the unity of all religions. Vivekananda is best known for his speech at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, where he gained recognition for his powerful oratory and deep insights into spirituality and human potential.</p>
